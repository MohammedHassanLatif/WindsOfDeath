# WindsOfDeath

 Created as part of a web game development module in my 4th year of University, Winds Of Death was developed over the course of 11 - 12 weeks.

We chose to design Winds Of Death as a 2-D co-op top-down zombie shooter, a subgenre that we think is very attractive for our desired audience. The games we got ideas from were: Boxhead: The Zombie Wars, Zombies Ate My Pizza, Dead Estate and Mecha Team Maverick.

Winds of death is a top-down shooter style game, which will be available on our website once we have finished the development of the game. The core audience for this game would be young adults and teenagers. We chose this audience as they are the ones most seen to play shooter games.

To make this game, we will be using WebStorm from JetBrains and Phaser Editor 1.5.4 as a development environment. The game will be made with the framework Phaser version 3.55.2 "Ichika", and the main programming language will be JavaScript.

The goal of the game is to kill as many zombies as possible while progressing through a series of linear levels. There will be opportunities to use different guns throughout the levels to aid player progress.
